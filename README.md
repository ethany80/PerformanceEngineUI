## Abstract
Our project aims to improve the way financial advisors generate performance reports relative to both customization and efficiency. We
do this by providing a simple interface and basic functionalities for selecting and placing report components, as well as integrating
the OpenAI API to generate entire reports from laymanâ€™s terms requests. We take a minimalist approach to the UI design,
ensuring that even those with very little experience are be able to quickly adopt the platform. This new way of generating reports
will allow advisors to more quickly display personalized metrics to their clients without the need for extensive training or outsourced
labor.
